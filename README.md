# C_U-Fish-Blender-Ray-Tracing
 This repo contains all of the files for my individual Blender project designed for illustrating the strength of ray tracing and customizing a set of attributes in Blender (including customized texture nodes, shader nodes, and attributes of [Cycles Engine](https://www.cycles-renderer.org/)) particularly for food rendering..



Detailed development logs are recorded in [Project Logs](https://github.com/CU2018/C_U-Fish-Blender-Ray-Tracing/blob/master/Project%20Documents/Project%20Logs.md) under the folder named "[Project Documentation](https://github.com/CU2018/C_U-Fish-Blender-Ray-Tracing/tree/master/Project%20Documents)"
