# C_U-Fish-Blender
 This repo contains all of the files for my individual Blender project designed for illustrating the pros and cons of ray tracing (with [Cycles Engine](https://www.cycles-renderer.org/)), as well as  strengths and weaknesses with rasterization (with [Eevee](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/eevee/index.html)). The main model in this project is a Chinese dish - grilled fish. The processes of modeling, sculpting, UV layout, texturing, lighting and rendering (images and animations) were all finished with **Blender**. Some of the sculpting (the fish) and texturing were assisted and finished in **ZBrush** (for sculpting) and **Substance Painter** (for texturing). 



Detailed development logs are recorded in [Project Logs](https://github.com/CU2018/C_U-Fish-Blender-Ray-Tracing/blob/master/Project%20Documents/Project%20Logs.md) under the folder named "[Project Documentation](https://github.com/CU2018/C_U-Fish-Blender-Ray-Tracing/tree/master/Project%20Documents)"
